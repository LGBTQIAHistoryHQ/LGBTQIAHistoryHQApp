                <p class="citation">In this image, Ignorance = Fear / Silecne = Death, Keith Haring uses the inverted pink triangle. This symbol was originally used by Nazis to brand gay prisoners, just like the yellow star was used to identify Jewish prisoners. In the 1970s, the pink triangle (inverted in shape from the Nazi use) was "reclaimed" as a symbol of the gay rights movement.</p>

            <p class="text">HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a disease that attacks your immune system, preventing your body from fighting infections and diseases. If left untreated it could lead to an AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) diagnosis. People with AIDS diagnosis have a much greater risk for serious medical conditions, due to their weakened immune systems.<br>HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids and physical contact (sexual and other, such as kissing and hugging). While HIV is more common in some communities than in others, anyone can acquire HIV through behaviors that are likely to transmit the virus. It's what you do, not who you are, that increases your chances of contracting HIV.<br>In the late 80s and early 90s an AIDS epidemic swept the US, particularly New York. It claimed the lives of 40,000 people in five years, predominantly those of gay men. While AIDS was decimating the queer community many including the government stood by, even referring to gay men with AIDS as "guilty victims". AIDS was deeply stigmatized, under-researched, and under-reported.</p>
