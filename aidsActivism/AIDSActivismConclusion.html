            <p class="text">During the AIDS epidemic ACT UP achieved remarkable results. They staged impactful protests that drew media attention and the way queer people were perceived began to change. The press began to report on how hard the queer community was fighting for their lives rather than how helpless (and to blame) they were. ACT UP demonstrates the power of organization for a specific cause.</p>
