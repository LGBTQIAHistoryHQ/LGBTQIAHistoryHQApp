            <p class="boldText">"Students Want Facts, Not Fear. LaFollette wants votes." ACT UP/LA. April 29, 1988.</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">At the request of Assemblyperson Marian LaFollette, the Republican caucus of the State Assembly recently voted unanimously to oppose funding for new programs in Los Angeles public schools until the Los Angeles Unified School District ends its historic support of Project 10. Project 10, coordinated by Virginia Uribe, provides counseling to Lesbian and Gay high school students and serves as an important center for AIDS education.</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">If LaFollette insists on attacking Project 10 and on using AIDS as a path to re-election, then we must ask these questions:</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">What has LaFollette done to make sure every student in California receives accurate information about AIDS prevention education for all students?</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">Why does LaFollette insist on endangering young lives by threatening Project 10, a major source of AIDS prevention education for all students?</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">Why does LaFollette what to deny counseling to an oppressed minority?</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">WE DEMAND that LaFollette work to reverse Assembly opposition to Project 10 and that LaFollette sponsor legislation that insures ALL California students receive accurate, timely and explicit AIDS prevention education.</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">****</p>
